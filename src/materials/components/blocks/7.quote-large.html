  <p>“We want to touch homes, families, lives, universities, schools, prisons,
  and hearts with a message of faith and hope. Our mandate is to rethink
  church norms, build on the foundations others have laid and see the church
  of New Zealand overflow with life. These are the days of revival, these
  are the moments of the harvest.”</p>
