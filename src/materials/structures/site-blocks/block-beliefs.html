              Sin has separated us from God and His purpose for our lives. </p>

            <p>We believe that Jesus died on the cross and shed His blood the for our sins. </p>

            <p>We believe that all the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God’s power and are thus secure in Christ forever. </p>

            <p>We believe that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word believe that by placing our faith is Jesus we receive this free gift of salvation.</p>

            <p>We believe that the true church comprises all who have been justified by God’s grace through faith alone in Christ alone. They are united by the Holy Spirit in the body of Christ, of which He is the Head.</p>

            <p>The true church is manifest in local churches, whose membership should be composed only of believers. That local church should seek to model, in every way, the pattern of the New Testament example of Christian life, values, structure and power.</p>

            <p>We believe the Lord Jesus mandated two ordinances, baptism and the Lord’s Supper, which visibly and tangibly express the gospel. Though they are not the means of salvation, when celebrated by the church in genuine faith these ordinances confirm
              and nourish the believer.</p>

            <p>We believe in the power and significance of the Church and the necessity of believers to meet regularly together for fellowship, prayer and communion. We believe that God has individually equipped us so that we can successfully achieve His
              purpose for our lives which is to worship God, fulfil our role in the Church and serve the community in which we live. </p>

            <p>We believe that God wants to heal and transform us so that we can live healthy and blessed lives in order to help others more effectively.</p>

            <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back again as He promised.</p>
